### Data Notebooks

This directory contains the Python notebook files that pertain to web scraping and pre-processing.

As noted in the write-up, I did not finish automating the web scraping by the final submission, so I am only 
using data scraped from 2016-2023. After obtaining/scraping all the rawdata, the resulting csv file goes through preprocessing through the II_preprocessing notebook, which then outputs the 'cleaned_nba_data.csv' file that is used for feature engineering/Streamlit site.

In other words, these notebooks are **fixed; they do not need to be ran unless out of curiousity.**
