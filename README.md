# DATA-440-Final-Project: Preliminary Ideas

I have not finalized my project idea yet, but here are some options I'm considering:

  1. **NBA Future Success**: Predicting recently drafted NBA players' peak potential, whether it's a bench player who only gets 10 minutes on the court or a perennial All-Star
  2. **NBA or NHL Betting Algorithm**: Develop a UI that displays the NHL or NBA (still deciding which one) games for the given day, and gives the proper Moneyline or Spread pick for the matchup                                    based on predictions Machine Learning model.
  3. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: Build a ML model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions
