# DATA-440-Final-Project: NBA Prediction Algorithm using Machine Learning

Predicting the winner of an NBA game isn't just a hunch. The ability to accurately predict the outcome of NBA matchups affects a wide-variety of stakeholders,
from the casual fans betting with their buddies, to the die-hards looking for a solid Moneyline pick on DraftKings, to even NBA scouts who are tasked with researching
their respective opposing team on a Tuesday night. 

This project aims to integrate Machine Learning techniques with a variety of basketball statistics to forecast the results of an NBA game. The model will predict the binary outcome of each game (i.e. which team wins), along with the confidence level of the prediction. Each NBA season differs, from roster turnover to the ever-evolving style of play, which effects the value of certain statistics. Therefore, I plan on training the model on NBA boxscore data from 2021 and 2022, use 2023 box score data as my OOT (out-of-time) testing set, and finally apply the model to current NBA 2023-2024 games (which are just starting up!). 

The end-product will hopefully be a UI designed to display real-time NBA games scheduled for the day, which will display the models' winner prediction for each matchup,
along with the confidence level and some of the reasoning behind the prediction (e.g. most influential statistics). This will eventually require scraping the data from certain platforms,for I'd want to show the games' point spread and MoneyLine values.
